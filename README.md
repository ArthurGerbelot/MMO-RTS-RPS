# Project code MMO-RTS-RPS

## Summary


## The Universe

#### Hierarchy
 
 - The universe contain multiple **galaxies** *[0-max]*
 - Each **galaxy** contain multiple **spiral arms** *~[0-4,8] with **solar systems** *[0-99999+]* (`0` is the closest to the center)
 - Each **solar systems** contain **planets** *[0-max]* (`0` is the closest to the sun(s))
 - **Planets** can have moons 
 - **Planets** have **cities** and **outpost** (see *City/Outpost*)
 
The planet position is defined by `galaxy-spiralArm-solarSystem-planet`. Can be considered as an unique Id. *(Example: 2-3-150354-3)*

#### Facts

 - New player are populated the border of the galaxy (far for the center, where the **solar system** number is high)
 - More the player are close to the center, more the game is difficule (see *IA/Pirates*) but interesting in resources


## Players

## Planets - Cities/Outposts

#### Planets

 - **Planets** have a random:
   - size defined by the number of **regions** *~[1-5]*
   - temperature, color, ..
 - **Regions** have an unique **city** and a random number of **outpost** *~[2-6]*
 
#### Cities/Outposts

 - The **city** is the main part of a region. The player who control that city, gain the region's resources
 - If the owner of **city** also have **outpost** (on the same region), he will receive bonus (Ex: +10% resources, can have a special building, ..) 
 - Every player can take an **outpost** by attacking it (maybe not the first time)
 - **City** can NOT be taken if a player already have it. Only owner can decide to leave a city. (see *Colonization*)
 - **City** have a maximum of building, defence and unit that can contain (see *Buildings-QG*)

## Space Exploration / Colonization

## Raid (Tower defense)

 - Player can attack another player (or an IA) even if the target isn't logged
 - The player who want to attack have to move **Troops** using **Transport Ship** (See *Units** and **Fleet**)
 - A tower defense start between:
   - Defence with the **city/outpost** as base
   - Attack with **troop** and **special power** available on the **fleet**

## IA/Pirates

 - No-player **cities/outposts** are auto-generated by the game on random planet
 - **Players** can attack their base (who can be destructed)
 - Random even can append (cities/outposts attack, ship interception, ..)
 - More close planet are from the center of the galaxy, more evolued are the IA, more interesting are resources

## Multiplayer games
